Question
========
A survey with `r sum(n)` persons was conducted to analyze the
design of an advertising campaign. Each respondent was asked to
evaluate the overall impression of the advertisement on an
eleven-point scale from 0 (bad) to 10 (good). The evaluations are
summarized separately with respect to type of occupation of the
respondents in the following figure.

```{r boxplots, echo = FALSE, results = "hide", fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 5.8, fig.path = "", fig.cap = ""}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1))
plot(Evaluation ~ Occupation, data = dat)
```

To analyze the influence of occupation on the evaluation of the
advertisement an analysis of variance was performed:

```{r anova output, echo = FALSE, comment = NA}
options(show.signif.stars = FALSE)
print(myanova_print, quote = FALSE, right = TRUE)
```

Which of the following statements are correct?

```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(questions, markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
========
In order to be able to answer the questions the fraction of
explained variance has to be determined. The residual sum of squares
when using only a single overall mean value ($\mathit{RSS}_0$) as
well as the residual sum of squares when allowing different mean
values given occupation ($\mathit{RSS}_1$) are required. Both are
given in the RSS column of the ANOVA table.  The
fraction of explained variance is given by
$1 - \mathit{RSS}_1/\mathit{RSS}_0 = 1 - `r rss[2]`/`r rss[1]` =
`r round(r2, digits = 3)`$.
  
The statements above can now be evaluated as right or wrong.

```{r solutionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(ifelse(solutions, "True", "False"), explanations, markup = "markdown")
```
